## Description
In this repository I will upload the work done in my journey to learn Reinforcement Learning from scratch.

## Files in Repository
* **RL1 - Random and Linear Regression.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook in which I compare the performance of a random model with a linear regression in two games from OpenAI Gym library.
* **RL2 - QLearning with bins.ipynb** Train a model with QLearning to improve the performance of previous models in the same games of OpenAI Gym library.
